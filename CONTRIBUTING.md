# Contributing

This file describes how to set up this project for development and how to make contributions.

## Checking out the code

Check out the repository from GitHub as follows:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/mkai/dictionarydb.git
```

Then, enter the project directory to get started:

```shell
$ cd dictionarydb
```

## Installing the requirements

**Prerequisite**: We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management. Make sure that you have it installed before continuing.

Once you have Poetry set up, install the requirements:

```shell
$ make install
```

---

**Note:** if you want Poetry to use a specific Python version, you can use the `poetry env use` command to do so. For example:

```shell
poetry env use 3.8.5
```

This will make Poetry use Python 3.8.5. You can install and manage different version of Python using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

---

## Activating the virtual environment

You can use Poetry to launch a new shell with an activated virtual environment:

```shell
$ poetry shell
```

This is an easy way to run commands, but you will need to repeat it every time you open a new terminal window.

### Automatic activation

If you want a more convenient solution, you can use a tool like [direnv](https://direnv.net) to activate the virtual environment automatically when you enter the project directory. To set this up, put the following into a new file named `.envrc` inside the project directory:

```shell
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
unset PS1 # https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/PS1
```

You will need to run `direnv allow` the first time you `cd` into the project directory.

## Using the CLI

You should now be able to execute the `dictionarydb` CLI tool:

```shell
$ dictionarydb
```

This should output something similar to the following:

```
Usage: dictionarydb [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Set up and populate a translation dictionary database.

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  api     Start the API server.
  import  Import new entries into the dictionary database.
  init    Create the database schema for the dictionary database.
```

Refer to the [README](./README.md) for details on how to use the command line tool

## Starting the API server

If you want to work on the HTTP API, you can start a development server as follows:

```shell
$ make serve
```

This will start the server with auto-reloading turned on so that every time you make a change to the code, the server will automatically restart.

## Running the tests

Use the following command to run the test suite:

```shell
$ make test
```

If you need to check your code against the projectâ€™s style rules, you can use the `make lint` command. However, it is recommended to set up your editor or IDE with the following tools:

- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
- [pydocstyle](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/)
- [black](https://github.com/psf/black)

Integrating these tools with your editor will automatically check your code as you type.

## Opening a pull request

Feel free to open pull requests before you've finished your code or tests. Opening your pull request soon will allow others to comment on it sooner.

A checklist of things to remember when making a feature:

- Write tests if applicable.
- Update the [README](README.md) file if needed.
